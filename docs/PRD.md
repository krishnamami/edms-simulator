# EDMS Simulator — Product Requirements

## 1. Problem & vision

Mortgage origination data flows through a long, brittle chain: borrower
intake → identity resolution → document extraction → income/credit assembly →
decisioning. Most teams test these stages in isolation against
captured-once fixtures. The EDMS Simulator gives engineers a **runnable
end-to-end environment** that mirrors production AWS infrastructure (Aurora,
ElastiCache, S3, ECS, SQS) and accepts real-shape data through every channel
that production does — JSON API, PDF, image, email, chat, web form, CSV bulk
upload, MISMO/IRS XML.

The vision is "one local stack you can throw any kind of data at and watch
it walk the whole pipeline" — useful for integration testing, decisioning
verification, and shape-discovery before wiring real bureau pulls or third
parties.

## 2. Personas

| Persona | What they need from the simulator |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Platform engineer** integrating with Decision OS | A stable mock that returns the same shapes prod will return, plus knobs to inject conflict/edge cases. |
| **ML / extraction engineer** | A way to drop a PDF or chat transcript in and see what the extraction → confidence → assembly pipeline does with it. |
| **Underwriting / credit team** | Confidence scoring + conflict flags so they can audit which source drove a decision. |
| **Architect on call** | A fast local repro for production incidents (FK violations, schema drift, async-pool issues). |

## 3. Capabilities

### Shipped (✓)

| Area | Capability |
|---|---|
| Universal ingestion | `IngestRouter` content-detects payloads (`%PDF`, JFIF/PNG/TIFF, XML, list-of-chat-messages, etc.) and dispatches to the right adapter. |
| Channel adapters | API · PDF · Image · Email · Chat · Form · CSV · XML — all wired through `POST /ingest/*` endpoints. |
| Identity resolution | 3-strategy match (deterministic SSN-hash → probabilistic name+DOB → new record) with persistent xrefs in `applicant_identity_xref`. |
| Income assembly | Per-borrower assembler covering W2 / self-employed / rental / SSA / asset depletion / military, with versioned `income_profiles` (`superseded_by` chain). |
| Credit assembly | Synthetic tri-merge profile generator deterministic by `credit_band`. |
| Document generation | reportlab-rendered W2, paystub, bank statement, credit report; Pillow-rendered driver's license JPG; `package_generator` assembles full doc sets. |
| Document extraction | **23 doc-type extractors** wired into the indexer dispatch — 8 original (W2 / paystub / bank / credit / appraisal / HOI / flood / tax) + 15 new income / asset / property / loan-terms / employment extractors covering IRS / 1040 / Schedule C/E / 1099 / K-1 / retirement / brokerage / gift / AVM / 1004MC / purchase / URLA / rate-lock / offer-letter. All share the same contract: `(pdf_bytes) → (fields, confidence)` returning `({}, 0.5)` on any failure, `base_conf × fraction_populated` on success. |
| AI extraction fallback | Claude Vision (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) fires when a deterministic extractor returns empty (or no extractor exists for a doc type at all). Renders the first N pages as PNG, sends to Claude with a doc-type-specific field-hint prompt, parses JSON. Always-graceful — `({}, 0.5)` on missing key / disabled flag / network error. Gated on `ENABLE_AI_EXTRACTION=true` (default) and `AI_EXTRACTION_MAX_PAGES=3`. Cost-aware logging on every successful call. |
| Confidence ranking | `SOURCE_CONFIDENCE_RANKING` (IRS=0.99 … VERBAL=0.50). `ConfidenceResolver` picks the highest-confidence value across sources and flags >10% numeric divergence as a conflict. Per-pair overrides in `FIELD_CONFLICT_THRESHOLDS` (IRS↔W2 5%, IRS↔1040 agi 2%, URLA stated income 10%, AVM↔appraisal 15%, 1004MC 20%, RATE_LOCK↔URLA 5%). |
| Cross-doc graph | `COMPARISON_MAP` carries 43+ pairs covering IRS↔W2, W2↔paystub, Schedule C/E↔1040, 1099↔1040, K-1↔1040, OFFER↔W2/paystub/VOE, URLA↔W2 (stated-vs-documented via `monthly_income_stated_annual` annualization), URLA↔purchase, RATE_LOCK↔URLA, gift↔bank, AVM↔appraisal, purchase↔appraisal, 1004MC↔appraisal, plus the original employment / property / asset cross-checks. Reconciler emits typed edges (confirms / corroborates / contradicts) into `document_relationships`. **Cross-applicant comparisons gated by an explicit `_CROSS_APPLICANT_PAIRS` allow-list** (currently W2↔W2, paystub↔paystub on `tax_year`) so per-borrower fields (W2 wages, IRS wages, URLA stated income) never produce false-positive contradicts edges between primary and co-borrower data. |
| Extraction provenance | Every `document_index` row carries `extraction_method ∈ {deterministic, caller_supplied, ai_vision, none}`. Priority on upsert: `deterministic > caller_supplied > ai_vision > none` (a doc upserted by the indexer with `deterministic` correctly upgrades from `caller_supplied`; AI Vision doesn't downgrade). Surfaced on `/applicant/{id}/field/{name}` and as `extraction_breakdown: {bucket: count}` on `/applicant/{id}/graph/summary`. |
| LTV / PITI / DTI | ContextAssembler computes LTV (`loan_amount / min(appraised, purchase_price) × 100`), PITI inline (amortization + tax + HOI + HOA when PropertyAssembler's `piti_total` is null), and front/back DTI from PITI + obligations + income. Falls back through `loan_terms` (URLA / RATE_LOCK) → `app` row for the effective loan_amount / interest_rate / term — so the math fires whether the loan terms came in via the `/loans` payload, a URLA upload, or a rate-lock. |
| Chaos-tolerance | API boundary uses `Optional[Any]` on every numeric/bool field in `DocumentSchema` — unparseable values like `box1_wages="one hundred ten thousand"` land in `document_index` instead of being 422'd. Income assemblers use a `_f()` helper that never raises (handles None, bool, currency strings, AND unparseable strings → returns `0.0`); the bad field is silently skipped, the doc stays tracked / counted / graph-visible. Verified by `scripts/feed_chaos_loans.py` (5 scenarios: self-employed / co-borrower / property disaster / data-quality / stale-expired) reporting **VERDICT: ROBUST — 69/69 uploads succeeded, 0 failed, 0 crashes** across deterministic re-runs. |
| Caching | Redis (TTL-keyed, **fully async via `redis.asyncio`**) for status / income / credit / app-lookup / context / property / graph plus Tier-1 entity caches `asset:{aid}` (4h) and `identity:{aid}` (24h). |
| Persistence | Aurora-Postgres (asyncpg pool). FK-safe write order, JSONB columns, idempotent upserts. |
| Concurrency safety | Per-applicant assembly lock (`assembly_lock:{applicant_id}`, 30s TTL) serializes `_run_assembly` for the same applicant; bailed contenders persist their docs first so the holder's inner-merge picks them up. `BatchIndexer` processes distinct applicants in parallel under `Semaphore(10)`. Joint-application doc-merge fans out the primary + co-borrower PG fetches via `asyncio.gather`. |
| Application context | One-call `GET /application/{id}/context` returns nested `borrower` (income / credit / assets / identity / document_count / qualifying_monthly), `co_borrower_aggregation`, `loan_terms` (URLA / RATE_LOCK / PURCHASE_AGREEMENT merged), `conflicts: {count, critical: [...]}` (top contradicts edges), legacy `primary` / `co_borrower` snapshots (kept for backwards compat), property, vendor_checks, DTI/LTV, readiness flags, missing_items. Cached at `context:{application_id}` (TTL 30m). |
| Readiness flags | 19 flags covering: borrower (income_verified, credit_pulled, identity_verified, employment_verified, assets_verified, identity_complete, tax_docs_received), property (appraisal_complete, title_clear, title_received, insurance_bound, flood_cert_received), application (dti_calculable, ltv_calculable, aus_ready), loan terms (loan_application_complete, purchase_agreement_received, rate_locked — date-aware), and a cross-doc fraud signal (no_critical_conflicts). |
| Missing-documents catalog | `GET /application/{id}/missing-documents` returns 15 required slots (with `alternates` for W2_CURRENT∥W2_PRIOR / AUS_DU∥LP / HOI_BINDER∥HOI_DECLARATIONS) + 9 conditional slots (IRS transcript, 1040, Schedule C/E, gift letter, wind/hail, WDO, well/septic, HOA — each with the `reason` clause that triggers it) + `received` + `total_expected` / `total_received` / `completeness_pct`. |
| API | FastAPI app, structured-log middleware, all `/ingest/*` and `/loans*` endpoints. Three Decision-OS-facing API interfaces sit on top of the same data layer: **Application API** (real-time per-entity context — `/loans`, `/documents/upload`, `/application/{id}/context`, `/applicant/{id}/income-profile`, etc.), **Report API** (`/reports/{pipeline,conflicts,completeness,extraction-quality,income-verification}` — paginated cross-loan analytics with 5-min Redis cache), **Bulk Export API** (`/export/{entities,documents,graph,profiles,applications}` — streaming JSONL/CSV with optional `?since=` incremental cutoff and per-consumer watermark CRUD). |
| Auth + multi-tenancy | DB-backed `verify_api_key` resolves the inbound `X-API-Key` against the `api_keys` table (5-min Redis cache at `apikey:{key}`), with a legacy env-var fallback for tests. Every domain row tags `tenant_id` + every read filters on it; Redis keys are prefixed `{tenant_id}:`; reports cache key + every export stream filter on tenant. `Admin` API: `POST /admin/tenants` / `POST /admin/api-keys` (generates `edms_<32-char-token>`) / `GET` listings (api_keys masked) / `DELETE` deactivation, all gated by `Depends(require_admin)`. |
| Rate limiting | One ASGI middleware (`core/middleware/rate_limiter.py`) gates every authenticated request. Three tiers — **application** 1000/min, **reports** 100/min, **export** 10/hour — keyed by raw `X-API-Key` value (per-key, not per-tenant). `X-RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset` on every gated response; `429 + Retry-After` on bust. Bypass list covers `/health`, `/ready`, `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`, `/dashboard`, `/admin/*`. Fail-open on Redis errors. |
| Async webhook outbox | `WebhookPublisher.publish()` writes one `webhook_outbox` row per subscriber (one INSERT each) and returns immediately — uploads no longer block on subscriber availability. A background asyncio task (`core/webhooks/delivery_worker.py`) drains pending rows under `Semaphore(10)`, POSTs with `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10)` + HMAC-SHA256, marks `delivered` on 2xx, applies `2^attempts × 30s` backoff (cap 1h) on failure, flips to `status='failed'` after `max_attempts`. `POST /webhooks/{id}/retry-failed` resets failed rows; `/health` reports `{pending, failed, delivered_last_hour, oldest_pending_age_seconds}`. |
| Schema auto-migration | Lifespan applies `infra/schema.sql` against the connected pool right after `db.get_pool()`. Idempotent (every CREATE/ALTER is `IF NOT EXISTS`, every seed `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); `already exists` is `skipped`, anything else is `errors` with the first failing statement logged but startup continues. Off-switch via `AUTO_MIGRATE_ON_STARTUP=false`. Each ECS deploy auto-applies new DDL — no separate `apply_schema.py` task for routine rollouts. |
| Incremental graph backtest | New harness for testing 50-day arrival patterns end-to-end. `scripts/generate_s3_simulation.py` writes 90 docs across 5 loans with realistic patterns. `core/connectors/s3_connector.py` walks date folders incrementally with `(watermark, until]` window. `core/graph/incremental_builder.py` ticks N times/day: pull → save → reconcile → re-assemble → upsert `entity_states` → record `graph_build_runs`. `core/graph/snapshot_scheduler.py` copies live state into `entity_snapshots` (UNIQUE per `(snapshot_date, entity_id)`) for lineage replay. `scripts/run_backtest.py` drives the full 50 days inproc OR via HTTP — `--api-url` + `--api-key` lets ops run against the AWS deployment with no local PG/Redis access. |
| Multi-channel v2 simulation | `scripts/generate_realworld_simulation.py` produces 50 days × 10 diverse loan scenarios (clean salaried, self-employed, joint dual-income, retired fixed-income, first-time-gift, investment rental, refinance with no PA, H1B visa holder, post-divorce alimony, condo-HOA-heavy) × 9 source channels (243 files) with realistic per-loan arrival schedules + intraday bursts + missing-doc edge cases (LOAN-107 refi has no PA; LOAN-102 has two 1099s in one folder; LOAN-103 has 4 identity docs clustered). `--clean` and `--upload` flags drive `aws s3 sync`. |
| Channel-segmented connector | `core/connectors/s3_connector.py` dispatches per source-channel sub-folder under each date: individual JSON (`edms_pull` / `vendor_equifax` / `vendor_corelogic` / `ai_chat`), batched JSON arrays exploded into N docs (`los_encompass`), `_meta.json` + `.pdf.b64` pairs reading meta only with `evidence_file` hint pointing at the sibling binary (`email_inbox` / `borrower_portal` / `vendor_title`), and raw scans synthesised as `document_type=UNKNOWN, los_id=UNCLASSIFIED, requires_classification=True` for AI Vision (`shared_drive`). Date folders without any known channel sub-dir fall back to the v1 recursive scan. Funnel-stat log inlines per-channel counts. |
| `los_id → applicant_id` resolution | `IncrementalGraphBuilder.run_build` resolves `los_id → applicant_id` via `pg.get_application_by_los_id` (per-tick cache) when incoming docs lack an applicant_id — the v2 generators only know the LOS the system minted at `/loans` time. Co-borrower role correctly maps to `co_applicant_id`. Unresolved los_ids (including the synthesised `UNCLASSIFIED` from raw scans) log `unknown_los_id` and skip the persist step, keeping the document_index FK clean. |
| Entity state write-through | Every `/documents/upload` ends with one `entity_states` row per affected entity in the lending tree (borrower / co-borrower / property / loan_terms). State JSONB carries the rich sub-entity views: borrowers `{income, employment, credit, assets, identity, doc_types}` (15-slot completeness), property `{valuation, title, insurance, tax, inspections, doc_types}` (5-bucket completeness), loan_terms `{urla, purchase_agreement, rate_lock, aus_findings, doc_types}` (4-bucket completeness). Redis write-through under `entity:{entity_id}` (1h TTL). 4 new endpoints: `/entity/{id}/state`, `/entity/{id}/timeline`, `/graph/build-runs`, `/graph/watermark`. Wrapped in a top-level try/except so per-entity failures never block uploads. |
| OpenAPI / Swagger | Title `EDMS Knowledge Graph API` v1.0.0 with multi-paragraph description, contact + license, four ordered tag groups (Application / Reports / Export / System / Admin) each with prose blurbs. `custom_openapi()` post-processor classifies every operation by URL prefix and stamps the `ApiKeyAuth` security scheme on every non-public path. `summary` + `responses={200/401/404/422/429}` + per-Query `description=` on every public endpoint. Multi-content-type 200 examples on streaming endpoints. |
| Resilience | Anthropic upstream errors map to HTTP 502 with detail; email body fallback preserves attachment processing. |
| Walkthrough | `scripts/simulate_local.py` runs all 7 ingestion-+aggregation steps end-to-end. `scripts/run_backtest.py` runs a 50-day incremental graph build with EOD snapshots. |

### Pending (⏳)

| Area | What's left |
|---|---|
| `_handle_normalized_ingest_event` for non-API channels | Today, only API events drive the full aggregation pipeline. Chat/PDF/email events are produced but not merged into the profile via `ConfidenceResolver`. (Spec called this BUILD 12.) |
| ~~`claude_extractor.extract` body~~ | **Shipped Tier-3 (commit `1bde27a`).** `extract_with_claude` (async) + `extract_with_claude_sync` use Claude Vision as the indexer / pdf_adapter fallback. Always-graceful, gated on `ENABLE_AI_EXTRACTION` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| XRefStore startup hydration | After uvicorn restart, in-memory state is empty while Postgres persists. Causes `idx_applicant_ssn` UniqueViolation on re-run with existing SSN. Fix: hydrate from Postgres at startup, or have resolver fall back to a Postgres lookup. |
| `/ingest/csv` ingestion | Endpoint returns parsed signals + report; doesn't push events through the aggregation pipeline. |
| Live Claude extractor for image | Today image_adapter calls Claude vision directly; could route through `claude_extractor` for unified retry/cache. |

### Non-goals

- ~~Production-grade rate limiting / authn / authz beyond the dev `X-API-Key`.~~ **Shipped:** DB-backed multi-tenancy + per-API-key rate limiting across three tiers + admin scope CRUD.
- A UI. The simulator is API + scripts only.
- Real bureau-pull integrations (Experian / Equifax / TransUnion APIs). The
  `CreditAssembler` synthesizes a plausible profile from the requested band.
- A queue / async worker substitute. Local runs are synchronous; the AWS
  Lambda + SQS code lives in `core/lambda_handlers/` and `core/pipelines/`
  for production wiring but isn't exercised locally.

## 4. Functional requirements

| FR | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-1 | Each channel adapter MUST emit a `NormalizedIngestEvent` matching the schema in `core/ingestion/events.py`. |
| FR-2 | `IngestRouter.detect_channel` MUST classify a payload from content alone — no caller-supplied content-type. |
| FR-3 | Identity resolution MUST persist the golden record to Postgres before any application row that references it (FK ordering). |
| FR-4 | `applicant_identity_xref` MUST allow primary + co-borrower to share a `(source_system, source_id)` pair. |
| FR-5 | The pymupdf extractor MUST recover ≥85% of expected fields for each document type produced by the matching generator (W2, paystub, bank statement, credit report). |
| FR-6 | All chat-extracted values MUST be flagged `requires_verification=True`. |
| FR-7 | When a Claude API call fails with an account-level error, the email pipeline MUST still produce attachment events. |
| FR-8 | Anthropic upstream errors MUST surface to API callers as HTTP 502 with the upstream `detail`, not as opaque 500s. |
| FR-9 | Tests dependent on Claude MUST be skipped (not failed) when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent. |
| FR-10 | `simulate_local.py` MUST run to completion (exit 0) without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, exercising the deterministic 5/7 steps. |

## 5. Non-functional requirements

| NFR | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| Performance | CSV adapter MUST process 100 rows in < 2 seconds. Local API median latency for `/loans` < 200ms on a clean DB. |
| Reproducibility | Document generators MUST be deterministic given the same seed (content equality; PDF bytes differ because reportlab stamps a CreationDate). |
| Observability | All API requests log a single JSON line via `RequestMiddleware` including `request_id`, `method`, `path`, `status_code`, `elapsed_ms`. |
| Test coverage | New adapters require both a deterministic test (mock or content fixture) and, where applicable, a key-gated live test. |
| Safety | Local docker compose ports differ from defaults (5433 / 6380) so the dev stack can't clash with system Postgres / Redis. |

## 6. Acceptance criteria

The simulator is considered "running correctly" when:

1. `docker compose up -d postgres redis` brings both services healthy.
2. `python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/integration -q` reports
   `338 passed, 2 skipped` (live tests skipped without API key) on a
   fresh checkout. Integration + smoke add 11 more for `349 green`.
   `python scripts/stress_test_indexing.py` reports `23 passed, 0 failed`
   across 7 concurrency / cache / throughput / webhook tests.
3. `python scripts/simulate_local.py` exits 0 and produces:
   - 5 documents in `local_storage/demo/` (≈ 51 KB total)
   - HTTP 200 from `/ingest/pdf` for the W2 with `confidence=1.0`
   - HTTP 200 from `/ingest/email` with both body and attachment events
   - HTTP 200 from `/loans` with a fresh `applicant_id`
   - 2 rows in `applications` and 4 in `applicant_identity_xref` after
     STEP 6 (deterministic match)
4. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set + sufficient credit, STEP 1 chat extraction
   returns structured borrower / co-borrower / income-source data.
5. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set but no credit, the simulator surfaces the
   upstream error message clearly and continues; STEP 3 attachment still
   processes at confidence 1.0.

## 7. Dependencies & constraints

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12, Docker Desktop. Tested on Windows 11.
- **Locked Python deps** in `requirements.txt` (runtime) and
  `requirements-dev.txt` (test). Notable additions during build-out:
  - `python-multipart` (for `UploadFile` / `Form`)
  - `reportlab`, `PyMuPDF`, `Pillow` (Phase B)
  - `anthropic>=0.99.0` (Phase C)
- **External services**: optional Anthropic API for chat / image / email body
  / Tier-3 AI extraction fallback. Cost ≈ a few cents per simulate_local run
  when live; the AI extraction fallback fires only when a deterministic
  extractor returns empty, and is gated on `ENABLE_AI_EXTRACTION=true`
  (default) + `AI_EXTRACTION_MAX_PAGES=3`. Flip the flag off for zero token
  cost.
- **AWS**: production code targets Aurora + ElastiCache + S3 + ECS + SQS.
  Local stack uses Postgres 15 + Redis 7 in containers and `local_storage/`
  for documents.

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Anthropic API key leaks via logs | Adapters never log the key; `_claude_client` reads env each call (no print). `.env` is gitignored. |
| Schema drift between `infra/schema.sql` and a running DB | The lifespan now auto-applies `infra/schema.sql` on every API startup (`core/storage/migrations.py`); idempotent CREATE/ALTER `IF NOT EXISTS` so re-runs are no-ops. Each ECS deploy picks up new DDL automatically. |
| Confidence ranking diverges from real underwriting truth | The numbers in `SOURCE_CONFIDENCE_RANKING` are spec-driven; underwriting can override per-deployment by editing the dict — it's the only source. |
| `XRefStore` in-memory state diverges from Postgres | Documented in `context.md`. Workaround: truncate before each fresh demo. Real fix: hydrate from Postgres at startup. |
